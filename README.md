This is a Chipmunk Physics tutorial that shows you how you can use Chipmunk Pro in a top-down, tile-based game. The tutorial covers an easy way to set up controls and an easy way to generate the collision shape of a tilemap.

This tutorial continues where [Ray Wenderlich's tile based tutorial](http://www.raywenderlich.com/1163/how-to-make-a-tile-based-game-with-cocos2d) leaves off. You might want to read that one first.

About Chipmunk Pro
=

Chipmunk (the C-API) is free and open source software. Chipmunk Pro (including the Objective-C binding and optimized solver) is what we've built on top of Chipmunk. Chipmunk Pro can help you save a lot of time as it plugs into the usual Objective C memory model and familiar APIs. It even works seemlessly with ARC.
